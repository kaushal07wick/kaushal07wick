# Kaushal Kumar Choudhary 👋

**Python · FastAPI · ML · LLM · CUDA · Rust**  
Systems-first ML engineer who ships production inference, data pipelines, and fast backend services.

---

## What I build
- Production-grade backend services and APIs with `Python` and `FastAPI` for model serving and tooling.  
- Reliable data ingestion and ETL for analytics and retrieval augmented workflows.  
- LLM infra: prompt iteration, eval loops, lightweight retrievers and RAG orchestration.  
- Performance work: CUDA-aware inference optimizations and low-latency Rust sidecars.

---

## Experience highlights
- Built FastAPI backends that expose model outputs, instruments, and realtime endpoints used by product teams.  
- Designed and ran ingestion pipelines and ETL that feed OLAP and retrieval systems.  
- Implemented evaluation and ranking loops to measure and improve LLM output quality.  
- Wrote Rust watcher/updater services for low-latency node monitoring and state propagation.

## Quick wins I bring
- Make model outputs production-ready with clear APIs, validation, and observability.  
- Turn prototyped LLM flows into repeatable RAG pipelines.  
- Reduce latency and cost through targeted inference optimizations.  
- Ship small, high-impact features fast in early-stage teams.
